I always wanted to understand how computers boot into the linux kernel.

In this post, I will summorize all of my knowledge that I collected. 

This post is targeted torward advanced users, those who studied computer science or has a background. And also people who researched about OS development. Here it is summorized easily.

Before we start, let me list the most useful resources for OS development:

- [OSDev.org wikipedia](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)
- [Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch by Nick Blundell](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
- [BIOS Interrupts and Functions](https://ostad.nit.ac.ir/payaidea/ospic/file1615.pdf)

The post is written sequentially, which means it is recommended to read it from top to bottom. The progress is made in the same order as the post, so you can see me actually struggle and get back to previous points.

## Boot process

The first step is to understand how the computer reaches our kernel code from BIOS.

After POST occurs, which checks that the hardware works correctly, the BIOS starts the bootloader.

It looks for each bootable device (disk, floppy drive, cd rom). For each of the storage media is looks for sector 1 (first sector).

In sector 1 of the boot device, if the last 2 bytes are the magic bytes `0xAA55` then the device can be booted.

This is caled `Master Boot Record (MBR)`, thats how the BIOS knows if it should boot from that device. Today we use UEFI, but its not important, since MBR is simpler and I'll use it instead.

Note: the BIOS looks for each device in predefined order in the BIOS menu (boot order).

The first 510 bytes of sector 1 are the assembly code. This assembly code will be interacting with BIOS interrupts.

## Run assembly code in bootloader

Basic code that does nothing:

{% highlight nasm %}
ORG 0x7c00
BITS 16

jmp $

times 510-($ - $$) db 0
dw 0xAA55
{% endhighlight %}

The last 2 bytes are the magic `0x55AA` bytes

The first 510 bytes are the `jmp $` instruction which jumps to the same line as current instruction (infinite loop).

And the rest of the bytes are zeros (`jmp $` takes 3 bytes, so we are left with 510-3=507 bytes are zeros).

`BITS 16` means we are running in real-mode, and `ORG 0x7C00` is the offset from where we start. The BIOS always loads our bootsector onto address 0x7C00. The BIOS did hardware initialization and other checks, those required some memory. So to avoid our code to override the BIOS memory, it puts our code in predefined memory area 0x7C00 (in RAM).

We are working in `16-bits` which means we can only use addresses up to 2 bytes long.

Notice that we are working in little-endian (default for most CPU architectures to use little-endian), and so 0xAA55 appears as last bytes like so: `55 AA`.

Side note: big endian is used commonly in networking, I won't go into the reason, but its primaraly performance (little-endian) and readability (big-endian).

## Running the bootsector

To run the bootsector we can use `QEMU` which is an emulator that can run on any CPU architecture hosts that are different CPU architecture.

For example I can run x64 operation system in macOS M1 (which is arm64).

Here is screenshot showing running `QEMU` with the bootsector code below:

```
nasm bootsector.asm -f bin -o boot.img
qemu-system-x86_64 boot.img
```

### Print 'Hello World' in assembly

Code:

```nasm
[global Start]
[BITS 16]
[ORG 0x7C00]

section .text
Start:
    mov si, String                      ;Store string pointer to SI
    call PrintString                    ;Call print string procedure
    jmp $                               ;Infinite loop, hang it here.

PrintCharacter:                         ;Procedure to print character on screen
                                        ;Assume that ASCII value is in register AL
    mov ah, 0x0E                        ;Tell BIOS that we need to print one charater on screen.
    mov bh, 0x00                        ;Page no.
    mov bl, 0x07                        ;Text attribute 0x07 is lightgrey font on black background
    int 0x10                            ;Call video interrupt
    ret                                 ;Return to calling procedure
PrintString:                            ;Procedure to print string on screen
                                        ;Assume that string starting pointer is in register SI
    next_character:                     ;Lable to fetch next character from string
        mov al, [SI]                    ;Get a byte from string and store in AL register
        inc SI                          ;Increment SI pointer
        or AL, AL                       ;Check if value in AL is zero (end of string)
        jz exit_function                ;If end then return
        call PrintCharacter             ;Else print the character which is in AL register
        jmp next_character              ;Fetch next character from string
        exit_function:                  ;End label
        ret                             ;Return from procedure
String db 'Hello World', 0              ;HelloWorld string ending with 0

times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0               ;Fill the rest of sector with 0
dw 0xAA55                               ;Add boot signature at the end of bootloader
```

Here is the hexdump of the program:

![](/assets/2023-6/Screenshot 2023-06-29 212153.png)

We can see 'Hello World' appears in the dump, aswell as the last 2 magic bytes.

We can continue to play with assembly and do whatever we want in assembly, but we want to load the kernel.

## Understand CPU addressing

In 16-bit real-mode the CPU has 3 registers that are used for addressing:

1. `CS` - Code Segment
2. `DS` - Data Segment
3. `SS` - Stack Segment

You should read on the internet about them. Understand segments.

In a nutshell the addressing mode is called `segment:offset`:

We can access up to 1MB of effective address using segments. An effective address is computed by combining the base address from the segment register and the offset value. When we run `mov ax, [0xffff]` the CPU will take the value of `DS` and multiply it by 16 and add it to the address. So if `DS` is `0x1000`, then the address will be `0x1000*16 + 0xffff`.

Notice: `0xffff*16 + 0xffff = 0x10FFEF = 1,114,095` which is a little mode than 20 bits (`2^10=1,048,576`).

## Understand Disk I/O - CHS - Cylinder, Head, Sector

When we talk about hard drives, to get desired memory block we need to know where to read from or write to. 

This is where the CHS comes from. It specifies the cylinder, head and sector of the hard drive. Basically it is a 3D coordinate system.

![](/assets/2023-6/1024px-Hard_drive_geometry_-_English_-_2019-05-30.svg.png)

In a nutshell, cylinder is what physical platter we read from (in blue), head (or track) is the radius of the platter (in yellow), and sector is the angle of the platter (in red).

## Initializing the stack

We need to initialize the stack, so when we use it, it wont override other memory. Remember: the stack grows downwards.

Since our code starts at `0x7C00`, then if we initialize the stack pointer to `0x7C01`, after one byte push the stack pointer will override `0x7C01`, which is our code. We don't want that.

So we need to initialize the stack pointer to a higher address, or lower address. If we do it higher than `0x7C00` we still have to worry about the stack growing downwards. But if we initialize it to a lower address (lower than `0x7C00`), then it can't override our code.

To summorize, we will initialize the stack pointer going downwards, so it won't override our code:

{% highlight nasm %}

mov bp, 0x7C00
mov sp, bp

{% endhighlight %}


## Read from disk

Now we want to read different sectors of our code. Since 512 bytes isn't enough, we will make a bootable image of 2 sectors (1024 bytes).

The first sector will be regular bootsector code, and the second sector will be filled with 0xFF bytes. The first sector will read 16 bytes of the second sector and print it to the screen.

![](/assets/2023-6/Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 20.52.48.png)

The picture above shows how to read the second sector. In the bootloader sector (first sector) we have the code to read the second sector.

The second sector is filled with 'A' bytes, and then we print it to the screen.

Note: the disk number is stored in DL register right after the BIOS loads the bootloader. We save it in a variable called `BOOT_DRIVE`.

The BIOS reads the sector into memory at location `ES:BX` (remember CPU addressing?). We set `ES` to 0, and `BX` to `0x7e00` as a dummy example.

The code:

{% highlight nasm %}
[global Start]
[BITS 16]

    ; DL stores the current drive number, save in variable
    mov [BOOT_DRIVE], dl

; Second sector is filled with 'A'
times 512 db 'A'
{% endhighlight %}

Note: the BIOS stops reading when it reaches `0x00` (zero terminated string).

So it was luck that after the second sector, the next bytes are zero. We should never do that again, since its not safe.


## Understand the stack: SP, BP, SS

The stack is used for when we push or pop values. It grows from high address to low address. It grows downwards.

When we push a value, the stack pointer `SP` is decremented by the amount of bytes of the value.

When we pop a value, the stack pointer `SP` is incremented by the amount of bytes of the value, and the value is stored inside a register.

The `SP` points to the top element of the stack (last element pushed).

Now we have 2 more registers to talk about:

1. `BP` - Base Pointer
2. `SS` - Stack Segment

The `BP` register is like the stack frame. It points to the start (base) of the current stack frame. Stack frame is a block of memory when usually when we call a function. The stack frame is used to store local variables, and other data in the current local scope.

So the `BP` points to the current stack frame. It is used to debug the current stack frame for each stack frame, so its used extensively in debugging.

We can calculate how much bytes a function used the stack by subtracting `BP` from `SP`.

Lastly, the `SS` register is the stack segment. It is used to tell the CPU where the stack is located in memory (beginning of the entire stack, where it begins). It is used with the `SP` register to calculate the effective address of the stack. It is used in combination with `SP` to reach high effective address, more than a single register can hold (more than 2 bytes).

For example of `SS = 0xAAAA` and `SP = 0x0001`, then the effective address of the top of stack is `0xAAAA*16 + 0x0001 = 0xAAAA0 + 0x0001 = 0xAAAA1`.

Here is an image describing the stack:

![](/assets/2023-6/Screenshot 2023-06-30 180924.png)

This is my code. It first prints the value of `SP` register (`0x6F00`)

Then it pushes `AX` onto stack, which should decrement `SP` by 2, and we get `0x6EFE`;

Then it pops back `AX` from the stack, which should increment `SP` by 2, and we get `0x6F00` again.

## Write assembly in 2 files instead of 1

So far we written the assembly code in 1 file. We need to understand how to write code in 2 files so its easier to debug and write code.

The bootsector should not change. The size of the bootsector is still 512 bytes.

However now we want to add a second sector filled with 'A' characters. The bootsector will read the second sector and print it.

`second_sector.asm`:


{% highlight nasm %}

times 512 db 'A'

{% endhighlight %}

Now we combine seperatly the bootsector and the second sector:

```
nasm bootsector.asm -o bootsector.bin
nasm second_sector.asm -o second_sector.bin
cat bootsector.bin second_sector.bin > boot.img
qemu-system-x86_64 boot.img
```

## Include files in assembly

Instead of combining two assembly files like I did above with calling the compiler twice we can use the compiler once.

`bootsector.asm`:
{% highlight nasm %}

...

%include "second_sector.asm"

{% endhighlight %}

Now we can just compile:

```
nasm -f bin bootsector.asm -o boot.img
qemu-system-x86_64 boot.img
```

## Entering 32-bit protected mode

We want to switch 16-bit real-mode to 32-bit protected mode. To make it short, the reason is that it gives us more features, and we can use more memory. As the name suggests - it protects the memory from being accessed by different segments.

We need to understand `GDT (Global Descriptor Table)` and `IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)` to understand protected mode.

In 32-bit protected mode we can't call BIOS interrupts anymore. So how do we display something on the screen? In VGA mode we simply need to write to the memory location `0xB8000` and it will display on the screen. But in protected mode we can't do that, because we can't access memory directly. We need to use the `GDT` to access memory.

To enter protected mode:

1. Disable interrupts (`cli`)
2. Load the GDT (`lgdt [GDT_Descriptor]` - `lgdt` is a new instruction we never seen before)
3. Enable A20 line (set last bit of  `cr0` register to 1, this is a new register we never seen before)

Step 1 and 3 is easy. I'll talk about step 2 in the next section.

## Understand GDT (Global Descriptor Table)

We need to define the GDT in order to enter protected mode. The GDT will sit inside the bootsector code.

Here are some of the resources I learned from:

- [YouTube video]([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh5nPn2U_1w&t=326s))
- [OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table)

The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a system-wide data structure used in x86 protected mode to define and manage memory segments. It is a table of segment descriptors that describe the attributes and properties of various memory segments used by the processor.

The GDT holds multiple segments entries. GDT is a descriptor (list of properties) which describe the segments.

GDT must contain:

- Code Segment Descriptor
- Data Segment Descriptor

### Code Segment Descriptor

It describes the code segment.

Attributes / Properties:

- Size (of the segment). It consists of:
  - Base [32 bits] (the start location of the segment)
  - Limit [20 bits] (describes the size of the segment)
- Present [1 bit] (1 - if the segment is used, 0 - if the segment is not used)
- Privilege [2 bits] (Describes segment privilege level, implements memory protection / access permissions. 0 - highest privilege, 11 - lowest privilege)
- Type [1 bit] (1 - if code OR data segment)
- Type flags [4 bits]
  - Bit 3: Executable? (1 - if executable, 0 - if not executable)
  - Bit 2: Conforming (can this be executed by lower privilege level?) (1 - this segment can be accessed by lower privilege level, 0 - this segment can't be accessed by lower privilege level)
  - Bit 1: Readable? (1 - if readable, 0 - if not readable)
  - Bit 0: Accessed? (managed by the CPU, don't touch. 1 - if accessed, 0 - if not accessed)
- Other flags [4 bits]
  - Bit 3: Granularity? (If set, limit is multiplied by 4KB (0x1000), else limit is in bytes)
  - Bit 2: Size (If set, 32-bit protected mode, else 16-bit protected mode)
  - Bit 1: Reserved (0)
  - Bit 0: Reserved (0)

Now we decide how to build our OS.

In short, I will go with flat-memory model (not segmentation and not paging).

I will also run in ring-0 (highest privilege level). All programs can access all memory. Which is the easiest to implement.

So in my case I will set the code segment descriptor to:

- Base: 0x0 (code starts at 0x0)
- Limit: 0xFFFFF (maximum of 20 bits)
- Present: 1 (this segment will be used)
- Privilege: 00 (ring-0)
- Type: 1 (code segment)
- Type flags: 1010 (executable, not conforming, readable, not accessed)
- Other flags: 1100 (granularity, 32-bit protected mode, reserved, reserved)


In conclusion the code segment descriptor will be:

- pres, priv, type = 1001
- type flags = 1010
- other flags = 1100

### Data Segment Descriptor

The data segment descriptor is similar to the code segment descriptor, but it describes the data segment.

I will use the same values from the code segment descriptor, except:

- The first bit of the type flags will be set to 0 (data segment) and not 1 (code segment)
- The second bit of the type flags will be set to 0 (the flag is not conforming anymore but the direction flag of the data segment which if set, the segment expands downward direction). We don't want that so we set that to 0.
-  The third bit of the type flags is now 'writeable?' flag and not 'readable?' flag. We want to write to data segment so we will set that to 1.

In conclusion the data segment descriptor will be:

- pres, priv, type = 1001
- type flags = 0010
- other flags = 1100

## Defining the GDT in assembly

When we run we see that the letter 'A' is printed on the screen (left-top corner):

Because we entered protected mode, we can't use the BIOS interrupts anymore. What I have done in the code is modify the VGA memory directly to print the letter 'A' on the screen. The VGA memory is located at `0xB8000`.

The code is located at: [github](https://github.com/ShlomiRex/os_from_scratch/blob/8dd0efb5eb32796a2d67f7ab756258c80e03ca74/bootsector.asm)

Or here: [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/tw3MPkD5)

(maybe in the future I'll change the github repo name)
